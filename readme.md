# Allround Website Static Site Generator (AW-SSG)

Allround Website Static Site Generator (AW-SSG) is a powerful and minimalistic tool designed to create ultra-fast, static HTML websites using Tailwind CSS (for nnice formatting) and Jinja2 (with the help of Python) templating. This static site generator is ideal for deployment on Nginx or Apache servers (which most managed hosting providers like one.com uses), offering efficient preprocessing and flexible configuration through environment variables.
It has baked in support for Tailwind, FTP upload, Templating, Syncing (timestamp comparison), Forms (via PHP mailing provided that the hosting provider supports php), "Wiki like" referencing with preprocessor shortcuts and much more!

    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Environment**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory to define crucial site settings and other configuration values. Be sure that the remote FTP directory is correct; otherwise, you may encounter errors during deployment.

2. **Understand the Base Template**

   - AW-SSG uses `base.html` as the "mother" or base template. This template serves as the foundation for all other templates, such as `index.html` or `contact.html`. The `base.html` template includes common elements like the header and footer, and other templates extend it to maintain consistency across your site.

3. **Automatic Meta Tags and Sitemap Generation**

   - The generator automatically processes the `{{ meta_tags }}` variable in `base.html`, injecting meta tags defined in the `meta.txt` file located in the root folder. For example:
     
     ```
     name;viewport;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0
     name;description;{{ meta_description }}
     name;keywords;{{ meta_keywords }}
     ```
     
   - The generator also automatically creates a `sitemap.xml` file, ensuring your site is search-engine friendly.

4. **Generating and Deploying the Site**

   - Run the generator script to build your static site:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - The generated site will be placed in the `output/` directory. If you have correctly set up the FTP credentials in your `.env` file, you will be prompted to upload the site to your server automatically. This "automagic" upload simplifies the deployment process, making it compatible with most managed hosting providers.

5. **Blog Support**

   - AW-SSG supports blogs using the `blog.html` and `blog_article.html` templates. To create a blog post, use the prefix `blog_` for your template file, such as `blog_my_first_post.html`. The preprocessor recognizes this prefix, automatically generates the post, and adds a reference to it in `blog.html`:

     ```html
     <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md card flex flex-col items-center text-center">
         <a href="../blog/{blog_name}/" class="link flex flex-col items-center">
             <img src="{{ '{{ blog_picture }}' | static(1) }}" class="rounded-md" alt="{blog_title}">
             <h3>{blog_title}</h3>
             <em class="text-sm">Published {template_vars['created_time']}</em>
             <span class="link">Read more <span class="pi pi-rightcaret ml-2"></span></span>
             <span class="pi pi-{watermark_icon} ml-2 text-xl basecol"></span>
         </a>
     </div>
     ```

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file is crucial for configuring AW-SSG. Below are the variables you can define:

- **TITLE_SITE**: The main title of your site.
- **SUBTITLE_SITE**: Subtitle for your site.
- **BASE_URL**: The base URL of your site (e.g., `https://www.yoursite.com/`).
- **OUTPUT_DIR**: The directory where the generated files will be output (default is `output`).
- **GOOGLETAGID**: Your Google Tag Manager ID for analytics.
- **FTP_ADDRESS**: The FTP server address for deployment.
- **FTP_USER**: The FTP username.
- **FTP_PWD**: The FTP password (required for deployment).
- **REMOTE_DIR**: The remote directory on your server where the site will be uploaded.
- **MAIL_ADDRESS**: The email address used for sending emails (if PHP Mailer is installed).
- **MAIL_PWD**: The password for the email account (required for PHP Mailer).
- **PHYSICAL_ADDRESS**: The physical address of your business or entity.
- **X_HANDLE**: The Twitter/X handle associated with your site.
- **MAPS_SHORTCUT**: Google Maps ID for embedding maps.
- **TEL_NO**: Contact number, used for WhatsApp links.
- **WA_TEXT**: Predefined text for WhatsApp contact links.
- **PHPMAILER_INSTALLED**: Set to `TRUE` if PHP Mailer is installed on your server.
- **COOKIE_TEXT**: A short message about cookie usage.
- **COOKIE_ALERT**: A detailed cookie alert message for users.
- **HEADER_TITLE**: The title for the header within `base.html`.
- **HEADER_DESCRIPTION**: The description for the header within `base.html`.
- **HEADER_KEYWORDS**: Keywords for the header within `base.html`.
- **TITLE_404**: Custom title for the 404 error page.
- **TEXT_404**: Custom text for the 404 error page.
- **LINK_404**: Custom link text for redirecting from the 404 error page.

### Important Notes:

- Variables marked as `|crucial` in your `.env` file are mandatory. The static site generation will halt if these are not properly set.
- Variables with the `|open` flag are available for use as lowercase variables directly in your Jinja2 templates.

## Preprocessor Shortcuts

AW-SSG simplifies your templating process by automatically handling common file paths and references:

- **Image Paths**: `{{ picture.avif }}` resolves to `static/images/picture.avif`.
- **HTML Paths**: `{{ blog.html }}` resolves to the `blog/` directory.
- **CSS/JS Paths**: `{{ style.css }}` resolves to `static/style.css`.

These shortcuts allow you to write cleaner and more intuitive templates without hardcoding paths.

## Tailwind CSS Purging

To ensure your siteâ€™s CSS is as lean as possible, AW-SSG includes an option to purge unused Tailwind classes during the build process. This feature can be enabled or disabled at the end of the `main.py` script based on user input. This can be used in the `base.html` template like `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ tailwind_min.css }}">` 

After generating the site, you can choose whether or not to purge unused Tailwind CSS classes which is automatically done for you (with `
npx tailwindcss -o static/css/styles.css --minify`)
This command strips out any unused Tailwind classes from `tailwind.css` in the root directory, producing a minified CSS file optimized for production.

## FTP Deployment

AW-SSG supports FTP deployment, allowing you to "automagically" upload your generated site to a remote server. Once the site is generated in the `output/` directory, you can opt to upload it directly to your web server using the built-in FTP upload functionality.

After site generation, you will be prompted to proceed with the FTP upload. The upload process utilizes the FTP credentials and settings defined in your `.env` file:

- **FTP_ADDRESS**
- **FTP_USER**
- **FTP_PWD**
- **REMOTE_DIR**

This automated upload process ensures that your site is always up-to-date with minimal manual intervention, making it a valuable tool for maintaining your static website on managed hosting providers.

## Timestamps Handling

AW-SSG compares timestamps from your local output with those on the remote server, using a European time format. This ensures that only updated files are uploaded, saving time and bandwidth during the FTP deployment process.

## Social Media Integration

The `x_handle` environment variable can be used for social media handles or other custom links. For example, you can add an Instagram handle like this:

```env
INSTAGRAM_HANDLE=test|open     
```
Then, in your `contact.html` or any other template:

```html
{% if instagram_handle %}
    <a href="https://instagram.com/{{ instagram_handle }}" class="bg-pink-500 hover:bg-pink-700 text-white py-4 px-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center" target="_blank">
        <span class="pi pi-instagram text-3xl mr-2"></span>Follow {{ instagram_handle }} on Instagram
    </a>
{% endif %}
```
This flexible system allows you to easily integrate any social media handle into your templates.

## PHP Mailer Support

If your server supports PHP and you need to send emails from your website, set `PHPMAILER_INSTALLED=TRUE` in your `.env` file. Use the `install_phpmailer.py` script to install PHP Mailer independently. This will enable full email support for contact forms and other dynamic features on your site.

## Icons Support

AW-SSG supports popular icons through `woff2` formatted icon files. To use these icons, include the `popicons.css` in your `base.html` template. For example:

```html
<span class="pi pi-starsfull text-xl"></span>
```
This automatically loads the `popicon.woff2` file, rendering the "stars" icon for this example on your site. The integration of popular icons enhances the visual appeal of your static website.
